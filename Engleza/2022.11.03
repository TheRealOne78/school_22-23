2. Write an opinion essay in response to the following statement: Success in
life comes with takins risks or chances. Write your answer in 180-200 words.

It is hard to believe that nowadays we can find people who do not desire
success, either in their field of work, their hobbies or at least among their
group of friends. Unfortunately, the more people strive for success, the more
realise how hard it is to achieve it, mainly because it implies a great amount
of chance.

There are many ingredients for success, such as hard work, good connections,
talent interpersonal skills, charisma, or simply being in the right place at
the right time. While the first ones are achievable by will, effort and
dedication, the last one is of totally different kind; it can be done only by
being able to take your chances when you recognise them and also to take risks
from time to time.

Undoubtedly no one can guarentee success even if risks and chances are taken,
but it is a sure thing that without them, there is no way to reach it, as life
is full of surprises of all kinds that have to be welcomed and exploited.

In conclusion, I think that two directions should be followed: we should work
to achieve our dreams and be alert to whatever life presents us with.
