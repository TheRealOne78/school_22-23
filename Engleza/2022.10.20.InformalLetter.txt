You want to visit New York this year.
Write a letter to a friend of yours asking him/her to come with you. Ask about the period she/he would like to go and which places she/he would like to visit.

Dear Andreea,

How are you? How are things with you?
Did you pass all your exams?
How's your family?
I haven't written lately as I was so busy with my final exams.

But guess what? This summer I want to visit New York. As I recall, you also wanted to visit New York and I was thinking we could go together.
What do you think?
I would like to go in August but we could also go in June or July immediately after the exams.

We would obviously visit the Time Square and The Statue of Liberty.
Is there anything else you want to see?

See you soon, can't wait to hear your answer.

Best regards,
Iohanis
