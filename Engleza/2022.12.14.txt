What you don't know can't hurt you




The power of imagination makes us infinite
Without imagination, most of today's stuff wouldn't exist, probably even people.

Let's imagine a scenario of a world where people wouldn't have imagination.
The wheel wouldn't have been invented, meat would still be eaten raw because fire wouldn't be used, people would be dressed with leaves and so much more.
But because inventors had the necessary imagination and creativity, they invented all of these gadgets and made the humanity progress.

Now let's imagine a kid without imagination.
It's hard to imagine a kid without imagination.
Would they not smile, play, dance, sing or really just not do anything? That would be depressing. Period.

In contrast, keeping your imagination alive makes you create something nice in the future. Some people create heavy machinery, some design astonishing buildings, some make memorable movies.

For sure, with the power of imagination, there are infinite creations the human race can create.
